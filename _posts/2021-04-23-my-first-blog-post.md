Life never waits for anyone, it will go on if you want it or not. 
People will come, they go. But, what's constatnt throughout the 
journey of life is you. So, stop cursing yourself and pull your 
shit together and get going. Because, the time lost now will not 
come again. So give your best while you still can. Because, life 
will go on and on and on.
